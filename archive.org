3:23 PM Rachel:
  So, when you have time (again, no rush), could you make a fake dataset with the variables found in this document:
  https://github.com/Z2hMedia/biba-data-science-test/blob/main/data/data.md

  I based this off of `biba-backbot.playground_​prod.playground_​sessions` but excluded some of the fields. Could this fake dataset have:
   - one row for each session where eu.used.used, we.description, games are unnested to each contain only one value
   - I’m thinking a total of maybe 10-15k rows? Or whatever makes for a small enough .csv file.

  So, when you have time (again, no rush), could you make a fake dataset with the variables found in this document:
  https://github.com/Z2hMedia/biba-data-science-test/blob/main/data/data.md

  I based this off of `biba-backbot.playground_​prod.playground_​sessions` but excluded some of the fields. Could this fake dataset have:
   - one row for each session where eu.used.used, we.description, games are unnested to each contain only one value
   - I’m thinking a total of maybe 10-15k rows? Or whatever makes for a small enough .csv file.

ask from sarah:

following on your research into Biba play sessions in Manitoba (475 sessions
concentrated mostly around Winnipeg and Brandon), the sales rep for the
territory was interested in finding out, if possible:

 - The time frame of the sessions
 - How they are trending
   
And any other interesting tidbits that might help us support his sales in the
province?

  The backlog is a list of tasks that need to be done or features that have been suggested, but have not yet been designed or scoped out.

  :END:
  This list is for bugs, duh.

  If something is broken ( site is down, feature not working, etc ), a card should be created here. This is also where notes on steps taken to resolve the bug should be kept, so that if a post-mortem is required there's a log of what was done to resolve the issue.

** ToDo What is the ToDo list for?

  The ToDo list is where tasks for the week go.

  Each card should represent a task that can be completed within a day.

  When a developer assigns themselves a card, they move it to `In Progress` and add themselves to the card.

  :ARCHIVE_TODO: In-Progress
  :END:
  This list is for cards that are currently being worked on.

  If a card lives in this list for more than a day, it should be broken down into more discrete sub-tasks to better track how a feature is progressing.

instead of writing a multi-tweet thread on how Kids On Bikes handles getting
hurt when failing a roll, write a post about it instead

DMV tweet: https://twitter.com/dmsofvancouver/status/1376703275962134529

tweets that were drafted:

We talked about Kids on Bikes in our most recent episode -- it's a fantastic game that has a really neat dice system.

The thing I loved the most though was the guidance on what kind of things happen when you lose a defense roll when you're being attacked.

It feels like this is something a lot of TTRPGs that don't have health ( hell, even those with HP ) don't handle super well. 

As a GM in a game, I want to be able to describe ( you know, narrate! ) what happens when someone fails to defend themselves from an attack.

Often the only guidance is "go with the narrative flow" or something along those lines.

A system that tells you "if you fail the roll by this much, you're probably injured like <this>" is fantastic! 

Knowing when a character is lightly bruised vs had some bones broken vs "needs medical attention now or they _will_ die" is great, because it lets me get on with *telling the story* without having to pause the game to figure out with the player "how injured" they are.

And I'll admit, a lot of games that I've had this issue with have been one-page RPGs that don't have the space to detail a system like this -- which is totally fair!

But I've also run into this problem with other RPGs
