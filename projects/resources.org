** lvgl
[[https://lvgl.io/][site]] - [[https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl][repo]]

it's a "light and versatile embedded graphics library", ie: make nice looking
displays with microcontrollers and small displays

- works on raspberry pi, arduino, esp32
- site has tools for converting fonts & images
- looks like it works with lots of different boards & displays

[[https://github.com/yangyongzhen/golvgl][old go library]] -- 17 months old, so may not be fully up-to-date; but maybe can
use as jumping off point to make go pkg for latest version of lvgl  

** [[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32954180664.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.344f3c00egahUK&mp=1][ups lite]]
it's the recommended battery solution for the pwnagotchi, so it's probably a
good bet it's a good piece to use when i need a portable pi zero

** potentially useful project bits
not something that's the seed of a project on it's own, but could be useful in
various projects
