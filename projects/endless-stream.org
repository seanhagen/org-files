  Update the game states, added a vew things. Most important is the "Wave Animation Wait" state, which is a state the game goes to after processing and sending out updates, but before going to the next actors turn. It allows for the UI to show an animation or display a message before moving on.

  Something to keep in mind with the GDM stuff is the [license (full link to license on gamedevmarket)](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/terms-conditions/#pro-licence):
  
      4.  LICENCE (A) – For purchases made after 00:00 (GMT) on 15th January 2019
  
      4.1. A “Licence” means that the Seller grants to GDN (purely for the purpose
       of sub-licensing to the Purchaser) and GDN grants (by way of sub-licence 
       thereof) to the Purchaser a non-exclusive perpetual licence to;
  
      (a) use the Licensed Asset to create Derivative Works; and
  
      (b) use the Licensed Asset and any Derivative Works as part of both Non-
      Monetized Media Products and Monetized Media Products, with no 
      restriction on the number of projects the Licensed Asset may be used in. In 
      either case, the Licensed Assets can be used in Media Products that are 
      either:
  
      i) used for the Purchaser’s own personal use; and/or
  
      ii) used for the Purchaser’s commercial use in which case it may be 
      distributed, sold and supplied by the Purchaser for any fee that the 
      Purchaser may determine.
  
      4.2. A Licence does not allow the Purchaser to:
  
      (a) Use the Licensed Asset or Derivative Works in a logo, trademark or 
      service mark;
  
      (b) Use, sell, share, transfer, give away, sublicense or redistribute the 
      Licensed Asset or Derivate Works other than as part of the relevant Media 
      Product; or
  
      (c) Allow the user of the Media Product to extract the Licensed Asset or 
      Derivative Works and use them outside of the relevant Media Product.
  
  
  Basically we can use them *in* the game, we just can't use them in a logo, can't resell them, and can't let users get them for free ( somehow )
