** ideation for new music-based game                   :@work:research:game:
burke has partnered with [[https://www.percussionplay.com][Percussion Play]] to add musical equipment to playgrounds
and matt wants to think about building a music-themed Biba game in the same vein
as [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naturalmotion.clumsyninja&hl=en_CA&gl=US][Clumsy Ninja]]

  - start with one Biba robot
  - play music on the per.play equipment to train them to get better
    - level them up?
  - after a certain point, you get access to another robot
  - keep going, repeating until you've got a whole band

goal: ????


things to look into:

 - microphone sensitivity -- how easy is it to have the game pick up that you're
   playing one of the instruments
 - recognizing tones -- can the game (with or without a data connection)
   recognize what notes someone has played
   - does this require an ML model?
   - if it does require an ML model, what is required to train it?
   - how big would the model be?
 - have the robot remember what you played
   - how long?
   - can you share the 'songs' you make?

other gameplay features to think about:

 - how to integrate ar?
   - record kid playing with robots?

neat tool that works with bigquery ( and plenty of other data sources ) to do
collaborative editing on stuff
