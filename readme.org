* My Org Files

This is a repo for all my [[https://orgmode.org/][Emacs Org Mode]] files. I used to use Dropbox, but
Dropbox & Manjaro don't seem to play nicely together. So rather than continue to
deal with that hassle here we are.


* The Files, The Directories, And What They're For
** Directories
*** Root
**** archive.org
Where everything gets put when I use `org-archive-subtree`.
**** code.org
Currently empty
**** endless-stream.org
Trello board in Org form
**** journal.org
Notes and lists? 
**** mygtd.org
tasks, clipboard... and camping?
**** network.org
- todo list for home network
- list of old machines
- todo list for pfsense/router (should be part of other todo list, honestly)
- vpn stuff
- machines (list of machines with stats)
- vlan setup
**** personal.org
- reminders (scratch pad, or stuff that i need to be reminded of in a specific
  number of days -- ie, agenda stuff)
- todos (should be elsewhere, or better named?)
- meetings (non-work meetings & phone calls)
- ttrpg stuff (could probably be it's own file?)
**** projects.org
- project resources
- projects i'm working on (needs to be better expanded with todo lists and all that)
- project ideas
- house projects (can probably be cleaned up or better organized)
**** tasks.org
- todo list

this file can definitely be merged into another  
*** Agenda
*** Notes
**** hacking.org
- radio -- supposed to be a list of radio stuff to read, resources, etc; has
  other stuff in here
- cyberdeck -- supposed to be list of parts & resources, should be moved to projects
- hacking -- ?? lsit of parts, items, other stuff, can probably be put elsewhere
  (project resources?)
- testing thing -- was for testing out some other org stuff, should be in
  dedicated "scratch" org file
**** radio.org
- nets -- list of nets i want to remember, have programmed into radios, etc
- gear -- places to get gear
- other stuff -- just a link to weather radio canada right now
- scheduled nets -- supposed to be a list of scheduled nets, so i can have
  repeating items in org agenda
**** shopping.org
- tools -- list of stuff to build, cnc stuff, and power tools
- garage workshop setup -- can probably be trimmed down to just the stuff i want
  to keep
- home automation stuff
- house upgrades
- neat subscription boxes
- grooming stuff
- clothes
- purchase plans
- wood supply places
**** switch.org
literally just a list of what each port is connected to and what vlan it's
configured with
*** Pocket
*** Work
**** time-report.org
when i'm doing good at tracking my time on tasks in org, this is where i put the
clock table outputs for each week
**** work.org
- day off tracking -- so that the time report for a week can add up to 40 hours
  if i had a vacation or sick day
- code todos -- currently empty, should turn into a place for project specific
  code todos, maybe?
- work todos -- just general "stuff that needs doing for work", not necessarily
  project related ( or for todos before there's an "official" project )
- email todos -- capture target for when creating a todo that points to a
  specific email
- research todos -- general purpose "hey look into this stuff more"
**** work-taskdiary.org
- meetings (by year -> month -> day ) -- place for me to take notes during work
  meetings, checkbox lists of "do this stuff" and link to specific todo
  headings, etc
- tasks -- meant to be quick "hey can you do a thing" tasks ( stuff like "find
  the latest report for playground x" or "get errors from latest mailout" ),
  here so i can track time against these small tasks
* Plans
** Organize Things
Need to better organize all the org files ( as well as capture targets ).

Need a few "areas" to keep stuff:
- stuff that needs to be in the agenda (schedules, deadlines, etc)
- work stuff (non-agenda)
- personal stuff (non-project stuff)
- personal stuff (project stuff)
- note taking / getpocket-style "stuff to look at when i've got more time"
- "live capture" stuff -- meeting notes, etc
