** 00:00 back in vernon
 drove back up to vernon now that dad's out of the hospital. he is... scarily
 thin. apparently he hasn't weighed this much since before he met mum. at least
 he's sounding better. still a bit of trouble walking, but he's working on
 strengthening his legs by going for short walks.
** 11:36 new week, old habits
 as part of cleaning up work stuff, going to try and get back into using org
 mode to, uh, organize my life. hopefully this time i can get it to stick as a habit
