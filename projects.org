* Project Resources
** lvgl
[[https://lvgl.io/][site]] - [[https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl][repo]]

it's a "light and versatile embedded graphics library", ie: make nice looking
displays with microcontrollers and small displays

- works on raspberry pi, arduino, esp32
- site has tools for converting fonts & images
- looks like it works with lots of different boards & displays

[[https://github.com/yangyongzhen/golvgl][old go library]] -- 17 months old, so may not be fully up-to-date; but maybe can
use as jumping off point to make go pkg for latest version of lvgl  

** [[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32954180664.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.344f3c00egahUK&mp=1][ups lite]]
it's the recommended battery solution for the pwnagotchi, so it's probably a
good bet it's a good piece to use when i need a portable pi zero

** potentially useful project bits
not something that's the seed of a project on it's own, but could be useful in
various projects
- [[https://elmwoodelectronics.ca/collections/adafruit/products/adafruit-i2c-non-volatile-fram-breakout-256kbit-32kbyte][fram breakout]] -- 256Kbits of storage over i2c

[[https://vancityliveedge.ca/product-category/inventory/][local live edge wood supply]]

** recording videos of working on projects
need:
 - lapel mic for phone [[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00EO4A7L0][rode smartlav+]]
 - tripod for camera

[[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nchsoftware.pocketwavepad_free][android audio recorder]]

nice to have:
 - recorder that isn't my phone - [[https://www.amazon.ca/Zoom-Digital-Multitrack-Recorder-F1-LP/dp/B0797DCMGM/][zoom  digital recorder]]

** Stuff To Sell                                                :sell:
*** ttrpg themed soap
[[https://www.wholesalesuppliesplus.com/soap-making-supplies/melt-pour-soap-base.aspx][soap supplies]] ( wholesale )

two things that can be used to style the soap:

- shape
-- dice ( small hand soap, literally shaped like dice )
-- dice-inspired ( normal bar-sized soap, but themed to look like dice )
-- weapons ( swords, shields, fireball )
-- armor ( plate mail, etc )

- smell
-- d&d classes (wizard, rogue, barbarian, etc)
-- enemies (goblin, dragon, owlbear, etc)

need non-D&D themed stuff too
*** dice whiskey stones
[[https://twitter.com/KatVHarris/status/1387476640175824898][tweet]]
- apparently there are d6's and d20's out there
- learn how to make them, then make a full set
- determine how much effort that is, and if it's worth it to sell them
*** tabletop accessories
**** resin dice trays
easier to make once i've got a mold, way more fun color options -- including
glow in the dark!
**** custom dice
tricky, requires the dice molds and probably a vacuum chamber & pressure pot &
slower curing resin ( or at least more pot time )
**** dice rolling trays
*** ttrpg candles
- maybe focus on the non-fantasy side of ttrpgs ( sci-fi, cyberpunk, etc )
- for fantasy candles, do novelty candles ( swords, etc )
- can do novelty candles for other ones ( ray guns! ) -- especially if there's a
  wax that is super clear when it's hard
*** live edge wood furniture
- smaller things to start ( side tables, nightstands, etc )
- tables on comission only though

** better streaming setup
- key lights
 - [[https://www.amazon.ca/Cahot-Conference-Adjustable-Conferencing-Broadcast/dp/B08SQH19HK/ref=sr_1_20_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=Zoom&qid=1618444543&sr=8-20-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyU0VaVEYwQVk0STMyJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODAwNzQwM1VOUFZOMklFRUlNUCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTUxMDU0SkpLTUcwT1gzUlBWJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==][maybe these]]

** home automation ideas
*** humidity sensor to turn on bathroom fan
and turn it off when no longer humid
*** lights activated via security camera motion

** some woodworking project ideas
[[https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/15-surprisingly-simple-woodworking-projects-for-beginners-46626][list of 15 projects]]
** LoRa On A Mountain
- get a good antenna, see what kind of reception I get from Alouette Mountain
** Raspberry Pi Projects
[[https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-raspberry-pi-projects?utm_source=pocket_mylist][list]]
** pocket to org sync
- use the [[https://getpocket.com/developer/docs/overview][Pocket API]] to pull articles into an Org mode file
- pocket tags -> org tags
- use todo state for unread/read/archived
- store pocket id as properties
- can probably crib a lot of the trello<->org mode code

[[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-pocket/blob/master/org-pocket.el][here's a mode]] -- might do exactly what i want!

  Master System platforms—on a backlit, color IPS display using built-in
  controls. And if you’re more interested in doing your own thing, microByte can
  help with that too. Not only is it fully compatible with Arduino IDE, it
  allows you to run your own sketches from a microSD card without having to
  reflash the device! And if you prefer MicroPython, you can access an open
  source library that you can use to make your own games (or whatever else
  you’re into)."
