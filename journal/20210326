** 18:23  work, emacs, repeat                              :@personal:emacs:
- tested out the new capture templates for recording work that needs to be done,
  they work pretty great. just need to keep using them
- need to think about moving from pocket & trello completely  into org
- finally set up a repo just for emacs config, because i haven't touched my
  dotfiles repo in... years?
